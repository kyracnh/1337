# My Libft Project

The libft project is a coding challenge where you create your own C library by re-implementing standard C functions to better understand their inner workings.

### What is static Library ?
A static library is a collection of object files that are linked into a program at compile time, resulting in a single executable. It allows for code reuse without needing to recompile the library each time the program is run.

Libft is typically a static library. In the project, you compile your custom functions into a static library (usually named libft.a), which is then linked to your programs at compile time. It doesn't involve runtime linking like dynamic libraries.

# Static vs Dynamic Libraries

## Overview

Libraries are collections of precompiled code that programs can use. They help promote code reuse and modular programming. There are two main types of libraries:

1. **Static Libraries**
2. **Dynamic Libraries**

This document explains the key differences between the two types.

## Key Differences

| **Feature**                | **Static Library**                                | **Dynamic Library**                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Linking Time**            | Linked at **compile time**, becoming part of the executable. | Linked at **runtime**, loaded when the program starts or during execution. |
| **File Extension**          | `.a` (Unix/Linux) or `.lib` (Windows)            | `.so` (Unix/Linux) or `.dll` (Windows)            |
| **Memory Usage**            | Increases the executable size as the library code is included in each program. | Shared across multiple programs, reducing overall memory usage. |
| **Update Process**          | Requires recompilation of the program when the library is updated. | No need to recompile; the updated library is automatically used at runtime. |
| **Performance**             | Typically faster, as the code is part of the executable and no runtime loading is needed. | Slight overhead at runtime due to loading and linking of the library. |

## Static Library

A **static library** is a collection of object files that are bundled together into a single file. When a program is compiled, the necessary library code is copied into the program's executable.

- **Pros**: 
  - Faster execution because all code is in the executable.
  - No external dependencies at runtime.
- **Cons**: 
  - Larger executable size.
  - Needs recompilation when the library is updated.

## Dynamic Library

A **dynamic library** is a separate file that is linked to the program at runtime. The library is loaded into memory when the program starts or during its execution.

- **Pros**: 
  - Smaller executable size since the code isnâ€™t copied into the program.
  - Programs automatically use updated libraries without recompilation.
  - Shared across multiple programs, saving memory.
- **Cons**: 
  - Adds a small performance overhead during the runtime linking process.
  - Programs rely on the availability of the external library at runtime.

Both static and dynamic libraries serve different purposes depending on the needs of the program. Static libraries provide simplicity and performance, while dynamic libraries offer flexibility and memory efficiency.

# What are object files ?

# Object Files

## Overview

Object files are an essential part of the compilation process when building programs from source code. They are intermediate files that contain machine-level code but are not yet a complete, executable program.

## What is an Object File?

An **object file** is the result of compiling source code, such as C or C++ code, into machine instructions. These files contain machine-readable code that can later be linked together to form an executable or a library.

### Key Characteristics:

- **File Extension**: Typically `.o` (Unix/Linux) or `.obj` (Windows).
- **Contents**: Contains machine code, but not fully linked. External references (like function calls or global variables defined elsewhere) are still unresolved.
- **Purpose**: Object files are used by the linker to generate the final executable by combining multiple object files and resolving dependencies between them.

## The Compilation Process

The creation of object files is one step in the process of compiling and linking a program:

1. **Source Code**: Written in languages like C or C++ (`.c`, `.cpp` files).
2. **Compilation**: The source code is compiled into object files (`.o` or `.obj`). Each source file is translated into an object file containing machine-level code specific to the system's architecture.
3. **Linking**: Object files are passed to the **linker**, which combines them with other object files and libraries to produce a final executable or library. This step resolves any external references between object files.

### Example:

If you have two source files `main.c` and `utils.c`:

# GCC `-c` Option

## Overview

The `-c` option in GCC stands for **"compile only"**. It is used to compile a source file into an **object file** without linking it into a final executable.

## Example

Consider the following command:

```bash
gcc -c main.c -o main.o

- **Compilation**: 
  ```bash
  gcc -c main.c -o main.o
  gcc -c utils.c -o utils.o
```
# What is a Linked ?
A linker is a crucial tool in the software development process that combines one or more object files generated by a compiler into a single executable program, library, or another object file. The linker resolves references between different object files and libraries, ensuring that all function calls, variables, and other symbols are correctly linked.
